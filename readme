This program is designed to be used as follows:
- users create authors and add their books, 
- when an author is complete that author is added to the guiness book, 
- if an author input in the book breaks the record it will be updated 
- if that author does not break the record they will be ignored by the guinessbook.

The Author class can contain books, has to string methods, a name.  This needed to be a standalone class to ensure authors with the same name could be collected by the guiness book and still be treated as unique.  

The guinessbook class manages authors, attempts to take them as input, and if they break a record, updates the record based on the author data.  It specifically does not store authors, only the record data.
